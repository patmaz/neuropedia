# Neuropsychological Questionnaire
A neuropsychological questionnaire as a mobile app dedicated for Android OS.

Tools and technologies that was used:
*JavaScript
*SQLite
*jQuery Mobile
*HTML and CSS
*PhoneGap/Apache Cordova with file plugin to generate apk file.

This app contains two questionnaires composed of items with likert scale. Data can be stored in a local database and exported to the external HTML file.

As it is intended for clinical use, the items' content was removed. The app is prepared for the EMQ questionnaire, that's why EMQ IDs are used in the files. Nevertheless, this tool can be modified for other questionnaires with likert scale quite easily.
